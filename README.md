# Trello Timesheet Management with CAP ⏱️

Welcome to this Blog Series about “Trello Timesheet Management with CAP ⏱️”. 

In this Blog Series we will build a Multi Target Application running on SAP Cloud Foundry.
We will use the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model to build a Business Application that connects to the Trello APIs.

This way we can consume our Trello information/data to build a Timesheet Application with it.
A full Timesheet application using a HANA Database which its data is exposed via an OData V4 Service.
Integrated with a Node.JS Module to authorize and authenticate the user against the Trello APIs.

All these moodules secured by a single XSUAA service instance.

If you want to get more information about this whole setup and development process, I invite you to have a look at my Blog series about "Welcome to this Blog Series about “Trello Timesheet Management with CAP ⏱️".
